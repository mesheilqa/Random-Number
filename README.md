# Random-Number
Generate 500 random numbers and create a method to print the nth smallest number in a programming language of your choice.

We are printing the smallest number from generated 500 random numbers. We do this while we are generating random numbers. 

We could also do this after the generation of random numbers and by of use of some sorting algorithm. But then to provide optimal solution we have 
found the smallest number while generation.
